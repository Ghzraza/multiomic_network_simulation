Simulated Multi-Omic Integration and Network Analysis for Brain Signatures
# Multi-Omic Integration + Network Analysis Simulation

This repository contains a simulation framework for **multi-omic integration** of single-cell epigenetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic datasets. It demonstrates network-based analyses and AI-driven modeling relevant to molecular signatures underlying stress and depression.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase computational and analytical skills transferable to real-world neuropsychiatric multi-omic datasets.

## Features

- **Simulated multi-omic datasets:** Epigenetic (DNA methylation), proteomic, and transcriptomic single-cell profiles.
- **Data preprocessing pipelines:** Normalization, quality control, and feature selection.
- **Network analysis:** WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), MEGENA (Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis).
- **Interspecies simulation:** Human and mouse dataset alignment for cross-species insights.
- **AI-based modeling:** Predictive modeling of molecular signatures related to stress and depression.
- **Visualization:** Network graphs, module-trait associations, and integrated multi-omic feature heatmaps.

## Repository Structure


## Example Workflow

1. **Data Simulation:** Generate synthetic multi-omic single-cell datasets for human and mouse brain cells.
2. **Preprocessing:** Normalize and clean each omic layer.
3. **Network Analysis:** Construct gene/protein co-expression networks; identify modules.
4. **Multi-Omic Integration:** Combine epigenetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to highlight shared signatures.
5. **AI Modeling:** Use machine learning to predict phenotype associations (stress, depression) from integrated data.
6. **Visualization:** Plot networks, module-trait associations, and cross-species comparisons.

## Technologies

- Python: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `networkx`, `scanpy`
- R: `WGCNA`, `MEGENA`, `ggplot2`
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
