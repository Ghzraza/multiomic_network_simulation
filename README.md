Simulated Multi-Omic Integration and Network Analysis for Brain Signatures
# Multi-Omic Integration + Network Analysis Simulation

This repository contains a simulation framework for **multi-omic integration** of single-cell epigenetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic datasets. It demonstrates network-based analyses and AI-driven modeling relevant to molecular signatures underlying stress and depression.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase computational and analytical skills transferable to real-world neuropsychiatric multi-omic datasets.

## Features

- **Simulated multi-omic datasets:** Epigenetic (DNA methylation), proteomic, and transcriptomic single-cell profiles.
- **Data preprocessing pipelines:** Normalization, quality control, and feature selection.
- **Network analysis:** WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), MEGENA (Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis).
- **Interspecies simulation:** Human and mouse dataset alignment for cross-species insights.
- **AI-based modeling:** Predictive modeling of molecular signatures related to stress and depression.
- **Visualization:** Network graphs, module-trait associations, and integrated multi-omic feature heatmaps.
