# Methods: Multi-Omic Integration + Network Analysis Simulation

This document outlines the simulation methodology, rationale, and analytical steps used to demonstrate computational skills relevant to multi-omic neuroscience research.

## 1. Data Simulation

- **Epigenetic data:** Simulated DNA methylation profiles per cell.
- **Proteomic data:** Simulated protein abundance matrices.
- **Transcriptomic data:** Synthetic single-cell RNA-seq counts.
- **Human and Mouse Alignment:** Each dataset generated for both species; simulated orthologous gene mapping.

**Rationale:** Reflects realistic variability and allows testing network and integration pipelines without requiring real patient/mouse data.

## 2. Preprocessing

- **Normalization:** Log-transform RNA/protein counts; scale methylation values.
- **Quality Control:** Remove low-quality cells/features; ensure minimum coverage.
- **Feature Selection:** Top variable genes/proteins; relevant methylation sites.

## 3. Network Analysis

- **WGCNA:** Identify co-expression modules within each omic layer.
- **MEGENA:** Multiscale network construction for cross-omic module detection.
- **Module-Trait Associations:** Simulated phenotype labels (stress/depression) used to associate network modules.

## 4. Multi-Omic Integration

- **Method:** Concatenate standardized omics matrices; apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) for joint visualization.
- **AI-Assisted Discovery:** Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) on integrated features to predict simulated phenotype.

**Rationale:** Demonstrates ability to combine diverse molecular layers, highlighting network-based and AI-assisted multi-omic analysis skills.

## 5. Cross-Species Analysis

- Map orthologous genes between human and mouse.
- Compare module preservation across species.
- Identify shared multi-omic signatures relevant to depression/stress.

## 6. Visualization

- Network graphs for each omic layer.
- Module-trait heatmaps.
- Cross-species network comparison plots.
- Feature importance from AI models.

**Conclusion:**  
This workflow reflects the key analytical and computational competencies for multi-omic neuroscience research, emphasizing integration, network analyses, AI-assisted prediction, and interspecies comparison. It provides a transferable skill set to real datasets, like those in the Labont√© Lab project on stress and depression.
